TASK: Generate MachineProduct Import JSON

You are helping populate a Django MachineProduct database via JSON importer.

I will upload a machine specification PDF.

Your job is to extract the information and produce a clean JSON file that matches THIS EXACT STRUCTURE.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Be factual — only use information present in the PDF.
- Do NOT invent specifications.
- If a value is unknown, omit the field rather than guessing.
- Keep marketing text concise and professional.
- Key features should be short bullet-style sentences.
- Specifications must be structured name/value/unit where possible.
- Slug must be lowercase and hyphenated.
- The machine name must exactly match the product name in the PDF.

OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT JSON ONLY — NO COMMENTARY):

{
  "machine": {
    "name": "",
    "slug": "",
    "tagline": "",
